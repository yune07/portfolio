        <p>
        I come from Business Information Systems and work at the intersection of technology 
        and application. As a master’s graduate, I bring experience from university projects 
        and student roles in corporate environments. My background combines technical 
        understanding, analytical thinking, and a strong focus on users, processes, and 
        context. <br/><br/>
        I enjoy working where structure, logic, and design come together, and where 
        different perspectives contribute to better solutions. I work in a focused and 
        reliable way and value clear communication and thoughtful collaboration. What 
        motivates me most is developing digital products and concepts that are clear, 
        maintainable, and genuinely useful.
